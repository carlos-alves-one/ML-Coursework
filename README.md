# Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning Foundations: A Coursework Compilation

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive compilation of coursework focusing on predictive analytics and foundational machine learning techniques. Developed by students of Goldsmiths University of London, it encompasses a series of Jupyter notebooks that detail the exploration and application of various regression analyses, neural networks, and data preprocessing techniques.

## Objectives
- To understand and apply various predictive modeling techniques such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Polynomial Regression with regularization, and Neural Networks.
- To perform comprehensive data preprocessing including handling missing values, feature selection, and data splitting.
- To evaluate and select the best models based on performance metrics.

## Methodologies
The project employs a structured approach to predictive modeling:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature selection, and splitting data into training and test sets.
2. **Model Development:** Application of various regression techniques and neural networks.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Tuning, selection, and testing of models to identify the most effective predictive models.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for analysis and model development.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For documenting the code, analysis, and findings.
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc., for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## Setup and Usage
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/carlos-alves-one/ML-Coursework.git
```
Navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook to access the notebooks:
```
cd ML-Coursework
jupyter notebook
```
